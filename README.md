# pogobuf-signature
Signature generation and hashing for [pogobuf](https://github.com/cyraxx/pogobuf/).  
Used by pogobuf, so you probably don't need it directly.

## Rely on the following projects
 - https://github.com/laverdet/pcrypt (embeded inside the lib as it's not on npm)
 - https://github.com/starkevin/node-pogo-signature (embeded/modified inside the lib, npm version is old)

## Recent Changes
 - 2.1.x - Update to latest encryption after warn wave
 - 2.0.x - Move dependencies (pcrypt and node-pogo-signature) into the module so everything is on npm
